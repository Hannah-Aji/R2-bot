# R2_bot

## Motivation
Service robots are increasingly being used in various industries to automate tasks and increase operational efficiency. For example, in the restaurant sector, these robots hold a lot of potential for transforming traditional, time-consuming service processes.
In this context, the emergence of advanced robotics platforms such as the Turtlebot, coupled with the development of software frameworks, namely ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), has paved the way for the implementation of intelligent and autonomous service robots in restaurant settings. These platforms offer robust capabilities for perception, navigation, and manipulation, enabling robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic and unstructured environments.

## Project objectives
The main objectives we aim to approve is to:
- **Implement the desired robot operations, including navigation, obstacle avoidance, and task execution**
- **Use ROS2 as the framework for software development to ensure reliability and scalability**
- **Integrate sensor components, computer vision algorithms, and machine learning techniques for perception and decision-making**
- **Test and demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution with real-world variables  and with ideal performance standards**
